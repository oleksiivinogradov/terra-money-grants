This year a crypto investment to NFT gained a lot of interest for non-IT and non-crypto geeks. In 2021 Bitcoin and other crypto tokens has a new all time high price and people like to invest in space. This is a driver to growth NFT follow them.
Influencers, license companies, brands - all of them like to publish and sell own NFTs.
But most products on the market canâ€™t provide a clear simple user experience. Complicated user flow growth a scary of investors and stop them to invest. Influencers, license companies, brands can't grow in NFT space now for same reasons.
